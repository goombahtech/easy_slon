=========

Slony is a open source software solution, which replicate your postgresql data from one node to another. Using slony we can make all our production server data to available to slave server node. In any case, if your master server is down, we can make our slave server to up and running with out loosing any data. Configuring slony has been made much easier than slonik tools.

Please read the README.txt to get an idea on this project.
